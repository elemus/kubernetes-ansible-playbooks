Swapoff Role
=========

Disable swap, since Kubernetes will not run if it's enabled

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - swapoff
